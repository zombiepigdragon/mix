# NOTICE: THIS REPO IS DEPRECATED!
As of late 2020, Mix is being completely rewritten from the ground up, and this repo does not contain current Mix codebase.
The repository is public only for historical interests, not to track current development.

Development is still ongoing, simply not in this repository.

# mix Package Manager
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zombiepigdragon/mix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zombiepigdragon/mix)

`mix` is the package manager of the Lemix Linux distribution. As `mix` is currently nonfunctioning, this repository serves primarily for sharing and collaboration of development code. Please come back shortly when the distribution is prepared. See the output of `cargo doc --no-deps --open` in the meantime, if you're wanting to develop or are interested in development progress.
