# mix Package Manager
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zombiepigdragon/mix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zombiepigdragon/mix)

`mix` is the package manager of the Lemix Linux distribution. As `mix` is currently nonfunctioning, this repository serves primarily for sharing and collaboration of development code. Please come back shortly when the distribution is prepared. See the output of `cargo doc --no-deps --open` in the meantime, if you're wanting to develop or are interested in development progress.
